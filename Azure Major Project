This drive contains videos about the azure cloud computing mini project
This includes:
1) Creating a computer vision resource for OCR (Optical character recognition) and perform OCR on the images.
2) Creating an Azure SQL database using the sandbox environment and run a sample query on it.
3) Manage a password in Azure Key Vault. For this we can also use Microsoft sandbox free environment that can be used to do this task.
4) Configure Azure resource lock. Storage accounts are one of the easiest types of resource locks to quickly see the impact, so youâ€™ll use a storage account for this exercise. In order to apply 
a resource lock, you have to have a resource created in Azure.
