This drive contains videos about the azure cloud computing mini project
This includes:
1)Creating an azure storage account using the azure portal and create a BLOB 
storage(Hottier) inside a container. Uploading an image as well as a short video and set different access 
permissions(private and public). "ENABLE ACCESS TRACKING" and adding a rule in the lifecycle management policies telling that
i. if the page blob which we created is not accessed for 10 days then change 
its access tier to cool.
ii. If the blob is not modified for 45 days, delete the blob.

2)Creating a windows virtual machine using Azure and login using the RDP protocol
